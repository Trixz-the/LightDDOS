- This tool is for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk.

### Usage:
- Testing web servers by sending a bunch or requests to a certain `ip` and `port` and flooding it.
### How to use it:
- Start by cloning the following git repository:
```https://github.com/Trixz-the/LightDDOS.git```

- Then run the `main.py`	 file
